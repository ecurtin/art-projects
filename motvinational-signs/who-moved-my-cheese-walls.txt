 Have cheese makes you happy

The more important your cheese is to you the more you want to hold on to it.

If you do not change, you will become extinct

What would you do if you weren’t afraid?

Smell the cheese often so you know when it is getting old.

When you move beyond your fear, you feel free.

Imagining yourself enjoying new cheese even before you find it, leads you to it.

The quicker you let go of old cheese, the sooner you find new cheese.

It is safer to search in the maze than to remain in a cheeseless station.

Old beliefs may not lead to new cheese.

When you see that you can find and enjoy new cheese, you change course.

Noticing small changes early helps you adapt to bigger changes that are to come.

Change happens. They keep moving the cheese.

Anticipate change. Get ready for the cheese to move.

Monitor change. Smell the cheese…

Change. Move with the cheese.

Enjoy change! Savor the adventure and enjoy the taste of new cheese!

Be ready to change quickly and enjoy it again and again. Keep moving with the cheese.
